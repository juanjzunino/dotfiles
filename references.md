# Dotfiles resources
> Resources I've found useful to get started with dotfiles.

You'll find that most of my configurations are inspired by [Jon Gjengset](https://github.com/jonhoo), [Anish Athalye](https://github.com/anishathalye/) and [Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz](https://github.com/jjgo). I strongly recommend to take a look into theirs configurations.
